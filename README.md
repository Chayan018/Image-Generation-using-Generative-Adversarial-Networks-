Image Generation using GANs

This project is a deep learningâ€“based platform for generating images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It showcases how GANs can synthesize realistic images from random noise or guided prompts, providing a foundation for creative AI applications such as digital art, dataset augmentation, and style-based synthesis.

The project demonstrates the full workflow of GAN-based image generation, from training on custom datasets to serving results through an API and interactive web interface.
